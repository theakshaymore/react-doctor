Let coding agents diagnose and fix your React code.

One command scans your codebase for security, performance, correctness, and architecture issues, then outputs a **0–100 score** with actionable diagnostics.

### [See it in action →](https://react.doctor)

## Install

Run this at your project root:

```bash
npx -y react-doctor@latest .
```

Use `--verbose` to see affected files and line numbers:

```bash
npx -y react-doctor@latest . --verbose
```

## What it checks

React Doctor runs **47+ rules** across these categories:

| Category | Examples |
|---|---|
| **State & Effects** | Derived state in useEffect, cascading setState, missing cleanup |
| **Architecture** | Nested component definitions, giant components, inline render functions |
| **Performance** | Layout property animations, transition-all, large animated blur |
| **Correctness** | Array index as key, conditional rendering bugs |
| **Next.js** | Missing metadata, client-side fetching for server data, async client components |
| **Bundle Size** | Barrel imports, full lodash import, undeferred third-party scripts |
| **Security** | Hardcoded secrets in client code, eval usage |
| **Server** | Missing auth in server actions, blocking operations without after() |
| **Accessibility** | Missing prefers-reduced-motion checks |
| **Dead Code** | Unused files, exports, types, and duplicate exports |

## Example output

```
$ npx -y react-doctor@latest .

## Use with coding agents

React Doctor is designed to work with coding agents like Cursor, Claude Code, Codex, and Copilot. Run it in your project, then paste the output into your agent to get fixes.

```bash
npx -y react-doctor@latest . --verbose
```

The `--verbose` flag includes file paths and line numbers so your agent knows exactly where to look.
